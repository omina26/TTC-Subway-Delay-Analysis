<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As businesses increasingly encourage employees to return to in-oﬀice
work, reliable transporta- tion is becoming more important than ever for
commuters. Many workers rely on subway systems for their daily commutes.
Subway delays can disrupt schedules, increase travel time uncertainty,
and even influence long-term decisions about where people choose to live
or work. While some delays may be unavoidable, understanding when and
where these delays occur, as well as how external factors like weather
conditions and population density contribute to service disruptions can
help both commuters and policymakers make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Motivated by the question, “What factors affect subway delays on
Toronto’s TTC?”, this study investigates when and where subway delays
occur within the Toronto Transit Com- mission (TTC) system and analyzes
the impact of weather conditions and service population density on these
delays using a merged dataset from multiple sources. Subway delay
reports (see reference) were obtained from the City of Toronto Open Data
Catalogue, providing details on location, time, and cause of delays
across the TTC subway network. Service population estimates were derived
from Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles (see reference), also sourced from
the Open Data Catalogue, while spatial data for neighbourhoods and
station locations was incorporated using the Toronto Neighbourhoods
shapefile (see reference), TTC Subway and Streetcar Map (see reference)
and OpenStreetMap API (see reference). Additionally, hourly weather data
from 2024 was retrieved using the Open-meteo API (see reference),
allowing for an assessment of temperature, precipitation, and other
environmental factors at the time of each recorded delay.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology" class="section level3">
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>To analyze the occurrence of subway delays and the potential impact
of weather conditions and population density, this study integrates
multiple datasets, combining transit delay re- ports, weather data, and
demographic information. The TTC Subway Delay Data from 2024, acquired
from the City of Toronto Open Data Catalogue, consists of 26,467 entries
with de- tails on the date, time, day of the week, station, delay code
(cause of delay), minutes of delay, minutes of gap between trains, train
direction (bound), subway line, and vehicle ID. For this analysis, all
columns were retained except for minutes of gap between trains and
vehicle ID. To account for population density, Toronto Neighbourhood
Profiles data from 2021, also sourced from the City of Toronto Open Data
Catalogue, was incorporated. This dataset includes 158 entries with
demographic information, from which only neighbourhood ID and total
popu- lation were used to estimate the service population surrounding
each station. Additionally, Toronto Neighbourhoods shapefile data,
obtained from the City of Toronto Open Data Cata- logue, contained 158
entries and 12 columns and was used for geographic mapping.</p>
<p>To further enrich the analysis, a custom subway station dataframe was
created by manually collecting the names of all 70 subway stations from
the TTC Subway and Streetcar Map and retrieving station longitude and
latitude coordinates using the OpenStreetMap API to allow for spatial
integration with other dataframes. Weather conditions were incorporated
using hourly weather data from 2024, retrieved from the Open-Meteo API,
which contained 8,784 entries with columns detailing the date,
temperature, relative humidity, apparent temperature, precipitation,
rain, snowfall, snow depth, cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction, and
wind gusts. All columns from this dataset were used to assess the impact
of different weather variables on subway delays.</p>
<p>Once collected, the datasets underwent extensive cleaning and
preprocessing to ensure con- sistency and usability. The TTC Subway
Delay Data, originally containing 10 columns, was filtered to remove
minutes of gap between trains and vehicle ID. Columns were renamed for
clarity, and duplicate rows or rows with null values in the bound or
line columns were removed. Subway station names were standardized, and a
new hour column was created to facilitate merging with the weather
dataframe. The day, station, code, bound, and line columns were
converted to categorical types to improve usability during analysis.
Most importantly, only observations with delays greater than zero
minutes and less than or equal to 30 minutes were retained, reducing the
dataset to 9,038 rows. The population dataframe was created by filtering
the Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles data to retain only neighbourhood ID
and population estimates. In the weather dataset, null values in the
snow depth column were filled with zero, and an hour column was
generated from the date column.</p>
<p>Data wrangling was performed to integrate these datasets into a
unified structure. First, the Toronto Neighbourhoods shapefile was
merged with the population dataframe using neighbour- hood IDs. Next,
the stations dataframe was spatially joined with the neighbourhoods
shapefile to identify neighborhoods within 0.5 km of a station, allowing
service population estimates to be merged into the stations dataframe.
The delay dataframe and weather dataframe were then merged on date and
hour to create a comprehensive dataset. Finally, service population
counts for each station were merged into this final dataset using
station names as the key identifier.</p>
<p>To understand patterns in subway delays, summary statistics were
computed for all numerical variables in the dataset. A histogram was
generated to visualize the distribution of delay durations, highlighting
the frequency of different delay times. The most common delay codes were
identified, and their frequency was plotted to determine the predominant
causes of disruptions. Additionally, delays were analyzed across subway
lines, train directions (bounds), and stations to assess variations in
delay occurrence by location.</p>
<p>Temporal analysis was conducted by examining delay frequencies and
average delay durations by hour of the day. A bar plot illustrated the
number of delays per hour, while a line plot showed fluctuations in
average delay durations throughout the day. Spatial trends were further
explored by identifying the top three stations per subway line with the
highest delay occur- rences and comparing their average delay durations.
A regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between
service population and delay duration, providing insights into whether
higher-density areas experience more frequent or prolonged delays.</p>
<p>A correlation heatmap was generated to assess relationships between
weather variables and subway delays. Finally, an ANOVA test was
conducted to determine whether delay durations significantly differed
across days of the week, stations, subway lines, and subway bounds,
offering statistical validation of observed trends.</p>
